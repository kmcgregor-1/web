Originally from upstate New York, I graduated from Wesleyan University (Middletown, CT) in 2024 with a degree in Astronomy and Physics. As an undergraduate I completed a thesis project with Seth Redfield on exoplanet population statistics and dynamics. I was also heavily involved in Wesleyan's astronomy outreach though the Van Vleck Observatory, and was a four-year student-athlete on Wesleyan's Swimming and Diving team. </p> <p>Over the summer of 2023 I completed a summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) project at West Virginia University, where I worked with Duncan Lorimer on a population synthesis of repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs).  This introduced me to this enigmatic class of radio transients, which I continue to study in my graduate work at McGill.</p>"},{"location":"about/#other-interests","title":"Other Interests","text":"<ul> <li>Astrophotography</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/#cv","title":"CV","text":""},{"location":"astrophotography/","title":"Astrophotography","text":"<p>In my spare time I am an amateur astrophotographer!
